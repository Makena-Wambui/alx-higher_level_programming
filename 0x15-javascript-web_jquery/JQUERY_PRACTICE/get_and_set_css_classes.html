			it's equally easy to manipulate the CSS of elements.
			jquery makes it easy to change the style attr using the css method,
			and classes of an element, using different methods.
		
			The class attr takes one or several class names.
			which may, or may not refer to a css class defined in your stylesheet.
			usually it does.
			you may add class names to elements so you can easily reach them from jquery
			This is because jquery provides support for reaching elements based on their class name.

			CLASS RELATED METHODS:
			hasClass() -> checks if one or several elements already has a specific class defined,
			addClass(), which simply adds a class name to one or several elements.
			removeClass().
		
		<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="ToggleClass(this);">Toggle class</a>
		-->
		<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="($this).toggleClass('bold');">Toggle</a>

		<div id="divTestArea1">
			<span>Test 1</span><br />
			<div>Test 2</div>
			<b>Test 3</b><br />
		</div>
		<script type="text/javascript">
			/*
			 * When the link is clicked, we send the link itself (this)
		         * as a parameter to the ToggleClass() method that we have defined.
		         * In it, we check if the sender already has the "bold" class.
		         * if it has, we remove it, otherwise we add it.
		         * This is a pretty common thing to do,
		         * so obviously the jQuery people didn't want us to write an entire three lines of code to it.
		         * That's why they implemented the toggleClass() method,
		         * with which we can turn our entire example here into a single line of code:
				check anchor element above.
			function ToggleClass(sender) {
				if($(sender).hasClass("bold")) {
					$(sender).removeClass("bold")
							}
				else
					$(sender).addClass("bold)"
			}
		        */

			//we can select multiple elements, where we can add or remove multiple classes as well

			$(function() {
				$("#divTestArea1 span, #divTestArea1 b").addClass("bold");
				$("#divTestArea1 div").addClass("bold blue");
			});
