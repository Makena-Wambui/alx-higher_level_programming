You can throw exceptions using the throw statement.
You can handle exceptions using the try....catch statement

Any object can be thrown as an exception in JS.
But not all thrown objects are created equal.
It is common to throw numbers or strings as errors.
However it is more effective to use one of the exception types -> ECMAScript Exceptions, DOMException.
